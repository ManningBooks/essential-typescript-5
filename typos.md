# Typos for *Essential TypeScript 5*

This file contains smaller errors that are unlikely to prevent the code examples from working and which I will correct in the next edition of the book. See [this](errata.md) file for mistakes that prevent the code examples from working as expected.

**Chapter 7**

On page 152, the text that describes the different types uses `false` as an example of a `boolean`, but the preceding listings use `true`.

**Chapter 11**

On page 266, the text following Listing `11.19` should be:

>The compiler will allow the data array to store **Person** objects and objects created from its subclasses.
