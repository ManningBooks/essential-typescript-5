# Typos for *Essential TypeScript 5*

This file contains smaller errors that are unlikely to prevent the code examples from working and which I will correct in the next edition of the book. See [this](errata.md) file for mistakes that prevent the code examples from working as expected.

**Chapter 4**

On page 102, the name of `calcTaxandSum` function in Listing 4.30 should named  `calcTaxAndSum` (with a capital A) to match the name used in Listing 4.31.

(Thanks to Joe Yakich for reporting this problem)

On page 103, the output from `Listing 4.3.3` should be:

    Name: Hat, Taxed Price: 108
    Total Price: 147.60

(Thanks to Joe Yakich for reporting this problem)

**Chapter 5**

On page 110, the sentence in Table 5.3 should be:

>   For example, specifying ~5.0.2 will accept version **5.0.2** or 5.0.3 (which would contain patches to version 5.0.2) but not version 5.1.0 (which would be a new minor release).

(Thanks to Joe Yakich for reporting this problem)

On page 113, this sentence:

>   The compiler can be run directly from the command line and will process all the files shown by the listfile option. 

should be:

>   The compiler can be run directly from the command line and will process all the files shown by the **listFiles** option.

**Chapter 7**

On page 152, the text that describes the different types uses `false` as an example of a `boolean`, but the preceding listings use `true`.

(Thanks to user156604 for reporting this problem)

**Chapter 11**

On page 266, the text following Listing `11.19` should be:

>The compiler will allow the data array to store **Person** objects and objects created from its subclasses.


(Thanks to Marshall Rosenstein for reporting this problem)
